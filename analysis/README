Yay, it's a directory full of undocumented Python scripts with no tests.

analysis.py             read and munge CSV files, build classifiers
logloss.py              log-loss cost function
test.csv                test set, chosen from 10% of branch instructions
training.csv            training set, chosen from 90% of branch instructions
visualise.py            data-visualisation code for use within PyLab
wularusclassifier.py    Wu-Larus branch classifier, for baseline
xval.py                 Cross-validation code


What the hell should I actually do?
-----------------------------------

Run `./xval.py training.csv` to get a report on classifier performance. To draw graphs, install IPython (http://ipython.org/) run `ipython -pylab`, and type

import visualise
visualise.show_prob_dist(20)
visualise.show_prob_cost(20)
hist_by_attribute(visualise.loop_branch)

to draw some hopefully self-explanatory graphs. Less self-explanatory is
visualise.scatter2d_with_jitter(), which performs Principal Component Analysis
on the dataset to squash the feature-space down to two dimensions, adds some
jitter so the points don't all overlap each other so much, then does a
scatter-plot.
